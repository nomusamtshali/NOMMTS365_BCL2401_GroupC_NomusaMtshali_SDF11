# Introduction

I was given a task to build a business landing web page for a fictitious banking solution, Cache Bank. I built a responsive web page using HTML5, CSS3 with Tailwind and Javascript.

# Elements Included

Prescribed Technologies - I used HTML, CSS, Tailwind and Javascript to build my web page.

HTML structure - To ensure the structure of the document aligns with the provided guidelines.

CSS Tailwind - I used it for all the styling elements that needed to be included along with the structure.

Javascript functions - For all the interactive elements such as links and scripts.

Page Responsiveness - I made sure that my web page is functional across different devices and screen sizes.

Footer - I included the contact information, email and location of the banking solution, Cache Bank. I also included the copyright information.

# Reflections

## Areas of Mastery

Proficiency in HTML - I believe I can now create a well-structured HTML document and I know how to use the HTML5s semantic elements in various ways in order to get the desired structure in my projects.

## Challenges Faced

Understanding breakpoints and how to adjust layout and styling for different screen sizes (desktops, tablets, mobile devices).

Applying CSS Flexbox and grid to my web page so that I can obtain my desired visual design.

## Areas for Improvement

I would like to improve my CSS Tailwind skills, as I was able to recognise its value in helping me code better and faster. I would like to learn how to apply different styles to my HTML tags so that I know to what degree I can use them in future projects.

I also want to improve on using flexbox and grid as I still struggle with understanding how to accurately make my code the way I want it to, visually.

### Overall Learning Experience

I got to learn more about responsive design principles and how much they play a role in shaping the final look of a webpage. This was, overall, a very transformative experience as it opened my eyes and showed me that I am actually developing the necessary skills and I'm able to build working versions of web pages. This boost in confidence will help me to create better web pages that adapt seamlessly to different devices and screen sizes and include more elements.
